# Archive Directory

This directory contains outdated files that were identified during the project audit and moved here for reference. These files have been superseded by the enhanced multi-agent system implementation.

## Archive Structure

### `/api-routes/`
Contains outdated API routes that have been replaced by enhanced versions:
- **demo/process/route.ts** - Old demo processing route without enhanced multi-agent system (superseded by process-enhanced)

### `/demo-pages/`
Contains old demo page implementations:
- **page-backup.tsx** - Backup file with minimal content
- **enhanced-page.tsx** - Old enhanced demo that simulated agent behavior (superseded by wow-factor-page.tsx)

### `/components/`
Contains outdated or mock components:
- **demo/bad-agent-thinking.tsx** - Parody component showing "bad" agents for comparison
- **demo/agent-thinking-panel.tsx** - Old agent thinking visualization with mock data (superseded by enhanced-agent-thinking.tsx)

### `/dashboards/`
Contains duplicate dashboard implementations:
- **(dashboard)/page.tsx** - Duplicate dashboard with mock data (duplicate of /app/dashboard/page.tsx)

### `/empty-directories/`
Placeholder for empty directories that were removed:
- **services/** - Empty directory with no files
- **types/** - Empty directory with no files

## Archive Date
Files archived on: 6/18/2025

## Reason for Archiving
These files were archived as part of a codebase cleanup to:
1. Remove outdated implementations that don't use the enhanced AI multi-agent system
2. Eliminate duplicate code and mock/simulated components
3. Create a lean, production-ready codebase focused on real AI integration
4. Improve maintainability by having a single source of truth for implementations

## Notes
- All archived files are preserved here in case they need to be referenced
- The active codebase now exclusively uses the enhanced multi-agent system with real AI integration
- Mock data and simulated behaviors have been removed in favor of actual AI processing
