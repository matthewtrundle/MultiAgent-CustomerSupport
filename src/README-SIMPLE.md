# Glass Car AI - Simple Implementation

## Current Structure (Clean & Simple)

### Core Demo Files
- `/app/simple-demo/page.tsx` - The Glass Car demo UI (200 lines)
- `/app/api/simple-ai/route.ts` - Real AI streaming endpoint (150 lines)
- `/app/demo/page.tsx` - Routes to simple demo

### What It Does
1. User asks any question
2. AI agents think sequentially:
   - Alex (Router) - Analyzes the question
   - Sophia (Customer) - Understands emotional context
   - Marina (Patterns) - Finds relevant data
   - Marcus (Solutions) - Proposes options
   - Alex (Final) - Makes recommendation
3. Beautiful real-time visualization
4. Works every time!

### How to Run
```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3022/demo
```

### To Deploy
1. Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in environment
2. Deploy to Vercel
3. Done!

## What We Removed
- 80+ complex files archived to `_archive/2024-06-19-glass-car-complexity/`
- Complex agent orchestration system
- WebSocket/Socket.io implementations
- TRPC API layer
- Database dependencies
- Hydration-prone SSR components

## Key Lessons
- Simple beats complex
- Demos should demo, not production-engineer
- 350 lines of code > 8,000 lines that don't work
- Ship it!
